**How disaster fixed trauma**
Aid workers knew they couldn't accurately guess what everyone in the region needed. A village maybe, but not the whole region. Last year's drought nearly decimated the hills but somehow the villagers were able to pull together.
If only we could talk directly to the people, the aid worker thought. Remembering the training exercise for Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, the aid worker thought back to their Master's degree capstone.
At the five day outdoor exercise, we werent even allowwed to suggest that everyone could self report their status using text message. It seemed like a realistic plan, and even the Christchrch earthquake wasn't good enough evidence.
At Christchurch New Zealand, a group of college students whipped together an SMS network of people sharing information and resources far more efficiently than the repsonders with internaitonal teams and lots of professional advisors.
The problems were never that mysterious, they just never got framed in the right way.
When a person is the first to emerge from a collapsed building, they must be able to recover from that moment forward.
Any technology that is built for people must secure the individual first.
A Sovereign individual has value by mere fact of breathing. They own valuable data and are an integral part of a healthy community.
The individual who is empowered happily joins into community, or not, it is their decision.
To recover from trauma, it is important to receive goodness when reaching out to determine your own destiny.
It is equally important to contribute one's own energy for the visible benefit of the whole.
This builds the body of one's existence. What you have, and what you need, as defined by you and nobody else.
To control that essential data, and to only engage in an exchange of value any time personal information is divulged, forms a new understanding of personal value.
The aid worker remembered a government official telling them how last year's budget for surveying population sentiment was over two million.
For a few hundred thousand the aid worker knew that a cardano based sidechain could provide an individual sovereignty in a scaleable way.
When sidechains are owned completely by an individual and is used as a record of their every civic interaction, many behaviors are emergent.
From the fundamental data point of one's physical location, all resources and matched needs are relevant based upon the distance from self, and the percentage of similar history in the sidechain of the party you are engaging into an agreement with.
Everything is an agreement of some kind. A contract for some exchange of value.
Whether goods or currency we don't care, so much as it needs to be recorded that it happened.
As each entity has their own side chain with publicly traversible metadata, authentication is done by comparing the receipt to those of counterparties.
It is understood that some governmental and medical access would enter another layer of personal privacy, but for a service exchange.
After comparing transactions, one would either become satisfied after enough layers were traversed randomly, or you would bump into another community member who has confirmed recently, or you might query a clearinghouse that can give an instant trust rating based on their 100% traversal.
In aggregate, all aprties in a locality will have authenticated for each other.
When a newcomer arrives, their traversal will depend upon network access.
When another party has a short chain, it would be fair to ask about the reason. It amounts to something much deeper than Bankruptcy.
The personal chain consists of requests for action on a Need, or Statements of one's own resources meant to be shared.
The range and breadth of one's broadcast is entirely up to the individual.
A relevant organization for a specialized need may be far off or in another country.
WHen sending out requests, a trusted governance will be working to resolve those needs. Individuals who participated actively are recognized by their metadata and transaction record.
Watching where requests go, and who matches them is an indicator of democratic openness. When the people are providing governance a to-do list, the order is fixed.
As each side chain matures, a network of efficacy emerges. This is in the form of a blueprint that can be shared with others, or even posted as a QR code on the edge of a city.
Scanning this network representation would tell displaced migrants where to go for shelter and resources in a way that empowers the two groups.
Such a system encourages the skills and abilities of travellers to be used to help the communities they are traversing, creating a culture of dignity and mutual empathy.
As nodes are not created, their relevance fasdes off naturally, so the network is self pruning through use.
As a record of actions, the receipt-chain is able to surface those with community organizing and logistical resource skills.
These people will simply be highly relevant for organizing and acting on behalf of the community. No 'argument and promises' politics, just the record of actions and concerns.
A safe contract container with an easy to use interface, that manages all personal information 'rental' will be able to manage all manner of personal interactions and fit within emerging services in the blockchain economy.
Has-Needs, or Ni-Aini in Yoruba, is a system and protocol for civic interactions that exists out of a cardano based side chain that acts as a record of all interactions involving what one needs and what one has.
Additionally a prosocial factor is coded in, that encourages the sharing of needs and resources as a community of proximity because larger needs are more realistic to deliver.
The major governance and aid organizations exist based upon their data about what the needs are. Due to the philsophical component of western education, simply asking the affected humans is not done.
Controlling and protecting ideantity must include securing other aspects of an individuals life-blood in a digital form.
Hardware and phone-app wallets are sophisticated enough to provide a seamless interaction with other types of messaging within the confines of a protocol.
The aid worker envisioned a day when offline survivors can share their networks and when the 'lights' come back on, everyone felt secure in the knowledge that frauds would be detected and their information remains secure.
Everyone who shared a network resource that provided some good to another individual, they both get 'sharing points' for feeding the system of good and 'burning' the 'Need' and its matching 'Resource' into a final contract complete action.
When voting, messages from anyone in the network can be sent to a relevant party or official security service etc. The voting prcess could be as simple as looking up the candidates' "responsiveness rate".
Political corruption quickly fades when the sunlight is constant.
Cardano smart contracts empower unlimited kinds of interactions, but the regular user needs to be guided to a better understanding.
